Image Generator with Style Transfer
ss This Streamlit app generates unique images based on a text prompt and an optional style image, using the kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-2-decoder model from Hugging Face. The model combines text-guided generation with image-to-image transformations, allowing users to create art with custom styles and themes.

Features
Text-Guided Image Generation: Enter a description, and the app generates an image based on the prompt.
Style Transfer with Optional Initial Image: Upload an initial image to guide the style of the generated image, or use the default style provided by the app.
Streamlit Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for interactive image generation.
How It Works
Load the Model: The app uses AutoPipelineForImage2Image from the Hugging Face diffusers library to load the pre-trained model kandinsky-2-2-decoder. Model resources are managed with CPU offload for efficiency.
User Input: A text prompt describes the image concept. Optionally, users can upload an initial style image.
Generate Image: Upon clicking "Generate Image," the app runs the text prompt through the model, applying the style of the initial image if provided.
Display: Both the initial (style) and generated images are displayed in a grid layout.
